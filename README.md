# Pizza Curse Club Backend 

Project Made in rust for our D&D sessions.
This backend acts as a crud for our admins and players to add in and list spells from D&D books.
This makes a easy and accessible way to find all spells we need. With it's description, name, level, components, duration, cast time and source
